JSONMAGIC, converts a json link to a table using just the url. FORKED FROM JSONHUMAN.
===============================================

This was created for use with import.io to work with json.

Use:
----

http://smashah.github.io/JSONMAGIC/#xrl="insert link here" 

It will work with or without URI encoded links, it will encode it itself if it wasn't already.

Why?
----

I really like import.io and wanted to use it to extract data from JSON.
